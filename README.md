# IRIS DATASET

## Plan: 

1.  _General Research_

2.  _Iris Dataset Projects research_ 

3.  _Ideas of what problem we want to solve_

4.  _Viability of solving in code_

5.  _Code plan_ 

  * Iris data set investigation (Python) 

    1. Need 1 code or function x 

    2. Need 2 code or function y 

    3. Need 3 code or function z 

    4. Need 4 /code or function w 

  * Iris data set results 

    1. Need of result 1 and code or function related 

    2. Need of result 2 and code or function related 

    3. Need of result 3 and code or function related 

6. _Analysis of results_

7. _Conclusion_


#### General Research 

- First approach: Looking for other projects and general info

- Difference between petal and sepal 

   Sepal: Sepals are leaf-like parts that enclose the flower bud 

   Petal: Petals are modified leaves that surround the reproductive parts of flowers

###### General Research about the data set
   Initial investigation by Fisher

   Fisher,R.A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in      "Contributions to Mathematical Statistics" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).

   (complex to understand the formulas and calculations)
   First approach in the paper presents the idea of a function that will maximize the difference between the means of the        standard deviations between the two species compared Iris Setosa and Iris Versicolor (Iris Virginica is not taken into        account in this first approach due to be colleted in a different colony)
   The investigation continues with the calculation of the sums of the squares and products of deviations from the means; and    indicates as well the degrees of freedom.
   
     CONTEXT
     What is a taxonomic problem?? 
     Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing and classifying organisms and includes all plants, animals and                  microorganisms of the world.

     Degrees of Freedom 
     Statistics: The number of independent values or quantities which can be assigned to a statistical distribution
